- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Inheritance affects my programming so far in that there are methods and accessors that I can just access from other classes that inherit from my parent class, and I find that very useful. I like being able to build off of a basic constructor for all types of buildings, and I feel like the way that we have used inheritance thus far just makes everything we are doing way easier. 

What didn't work: I am not sure how to retrieve a key from a Hashtable, so I was not able to create a printCollection() method for the library class that was as clean as I wanted it to be. 

What I am still unsure about: I still don't feel comfortable when creating my javadoc comments. I always feel like I am going overboard, and I also never quite know how to explain what each piece means. I think having more javadoc examples to look at in addition to the one on moodle would be greatly helpful.
